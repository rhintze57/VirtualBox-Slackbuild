You'll need to add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local:

	# Start vboxdrv
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv start
	fi

This will load the support kernel module for VirtualBox.


You'll then need to add the following lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local_shutdown:

	# Stop vboxdrv
	if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv ]; then
	  /etc/rc.d/rc.vboxdrv stop
	fi


Any user accounts that plan to use virtualbox will need to be members
of the "vboxusers" group.

In order to use USB devices in VirtualBox Guests you may have to restart
your host system after installing the virtualbox package.
